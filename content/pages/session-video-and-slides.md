**Description:** Video recording of _Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World_. This one-day workshop provides a brief overview of system dynamics and a hands-on simulation experience, the _Fishbanks_ management simulation. It also serves as a preview of the more in-depth coverage of system dynamics available in other courses offered at MIT Sloan.

_\[Note: The_ Fishbanks _management simulation portion of the workshop has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\]_
